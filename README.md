## Description
Hi this is my Random Password Generator. As you look at the home page you will find two buttons one saying "Generate Password" and the other saying "Copy to Clipboard". After clicking on "Generate Password" you will go through a series of prompts asking the user to set the criteria for their password. It will then generate a password using that criteria. The user can then copy their password to the computers clipboard for ease of transfer to another website or document.

## Usage
```md
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```
